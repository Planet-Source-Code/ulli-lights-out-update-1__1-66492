### Description

This was inspired by an earlier submission to PSC (whis seems to have disappeared when I looked for it again to give credit to the original author) and it will dim your monitor after a period of idleness or when you expicitely want it. It runs in the system tray and requires no measurable resources. ***Updated for smooth transition and TimeoutDisable. Try it, download is only 8.5 kB.
